<p>In the magic tube 37,000 feet above ground, this is exactly what I’m asking myself.</p>

<p>Kolton (my best bro) alluded to this in part in Indusion Lounge, post tequila, he says:</p>

<p class="quote">
  From Second Cup to San Francisco.
</p>

<p>The underlying message we understood was of Drake’s infamous “Started from the bottom now we’re here”.
Two young dudes from Fredericton, starting out, to accomplished dudes chilling in San Francisco, on business and pleasure.
It’s fun to imagine this. However, I must say it’s hardly coincidental, or “lucky”. The product of the “Anything is possible” mindset. I always say:</p>

<p class="quote">
  The world is mine because of these 2 things: It's possible, and I want it.
</p>

<p>Obviously there’s more to this blindly optimistic view,</p>

<p>We met 2 years ago in second cup, during a major power outtage in New Brunssick after a snow storm. Second cup was one of the few places we could go to charge our devices, get internet, and in our case, to work. We chatted up and instantly connected. We’d actually previously met at a Photoshop workshop he’d attended and I volunteered as an experienced volunteer. Fueld by Jumpman, poms in the late night (pomodoro sessions). Among my favourite memories with Kolton was coding remotely with him until 9AM (from the night before), prepping his dashboard for a Dragon’s Den appearance.</p>

<p>The significance of our relationship was a perpetual connection to the dream. We were, and remain dreamers. Self progression, independence, liberty from any quo, perpetual re-examination, and chasing the good life is mostly what we talk about.</p>

<p>“PMW” and “Pitches Pitches Porsches” be our mantras.</p>

<p>This 2 week séjour heavily reminded my of my time in Seoul. Although this time, on top of indulging in profuse drinking and extracurricular substances, I worked. And worked damn well.</p>
